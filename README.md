Opentree
========

2014 International Space Apps Challenge entry to gather crowdsourced data about trees. Details about the challenge can be found [here](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/project/open-tree/).

We used the challenge to help us work out 3 big ideas:

- Real scientific data can be collected by citizen scientists who are just old enough to use a smartphone. Crowdsourcing is a phrase that recently caught on, but it has been done well time and time again in the past.

- We can use existing infrastructures to do this instead of inventing our own. In this case we are using Flickr to capture, catalog, index, store and share data. This is cheaper, better, and familiar.

- We can solve a tough image recognition problem by using familiar objects in a novel way. In this case, we have our citizen scientists put a 8.5" x 11" piece of paper on a tree, then crop their images to the size of the tree, which gives us everything we need to figure out the tree's size fairly accurately.

Opentree will enlist citizen scientists to take pictures of trees in their neighborhoods. By pinning an 8.5" x 11" piece of white paper to a tree, they will provide a reference that can be used to figure out the real size of the tree.  By cropping the image to the tree's height and width, they will do the hard work of distinguishing the tree from the background.  Our citizen scientists will upload their images to Flickr, tagged with "opentree." OpenTree will do the rest.  It will collect properly tagged images, calculate tree sizes, and store everything (including location and time taken from the image).  The website will gamify further data collection by engaging visitors and providing "badges" for achievements such as collecting the most images in the area, or "owning" the image of the tallest tree in the region.
